This git repo is a fork of git://anongit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd
with the aim of isolating udev from any particular flavor of system
initialization.  In this case, the isolation is from systemd.

This is a project started by Gentoo developers and testing is currently being
done mostly on OpenRC.  We welcome contribution from others using a variety of
system initializations to ensure eudev remains system initialization and
distribution neutral.
