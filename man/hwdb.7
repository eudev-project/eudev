.SH "NAME"
hwdb \- Hardware Database
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The hardware database is a key\-value store for associating modalias\-like keys to udev\-property\-like values\&. It is used primarily by udev to add the relevant properties to matching devices, but it can also be queried directly\&.
.SH "HARDWARE DATABASE FILES"
.PP
The hwdb files are read from the files located in the system hwdb directory
/usr/lib/udev/hwdb\&.d
and the local administration directory
/etc/udev/hwdb\&.d\&. All hwdb files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. Files in
/etc/
have the highest priority and take precedence over files with the same name in
/usr/lib/\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied hwdb file with a local file if needed; a symlink in
/etc/
with the same name as a hwdb file in
/usr/lib/, pointing to
/dev/null, disables that hwdb file entirely\&. hwdb files must have the extension
\&.hwdb; other extensions are ignored\&.
.PP
Each hwdb file contains data records consisting of matches and associated key\-value pairs\&. Every record in the hwdb starts with one or more match strings, specifying a shell glob to compare the lookup string against\&. Multiple match lines are specified in consecutive lines\&. Every match line is compared individually, and they are combined by OR\&. Every match line must start at the first character of the line\&.
.PP
Match patterns consist of literal characters, and shell\-style wildcards:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Asterisk

matches any number of characters
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\

.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

.IP \(bu 2.3

Character list
[\fIchars\fR]
matches one of the characters
\fIchars\fR
listed between
[
and
]\&. A range may be specified as with a dash as
[\fIfirst\fR\-\fIlast\fR]\&. The match may be inverted with a caret
[^\&...]\&.
.RE
.PP
The match lines are followed by one or more key\-value pair lines, which are recognized by a leading space character\&. The key name and value are separated by
=\&. An empty line signifies the end of a record\&. Lines beginning with
#
are ignored\&.
.PP
In case multiple records match a given lookup string, the key\-value pairs from all records are combined\&. If a key is specified multiple times, the value from the record with the highest priority is used (each key can have only a single value)\&. The priority is higher when the record is in a file that sorts later lexicographically, and in case of records in the same file, later records have higher priority\&.
.PP
The content of all hwdb files is read by
\fBsystemd-hwdb\fR(8)
and compiled to a binary database located at
/etc/udev/hwdb\&.bin, or alternatively
/usr/lib/udev/hwdb\&.bin
if you want ship the compiled database in an immutable image\&. During runtime, only the binary database is used\&.

If the hwdb consists of those two files, a keyboard with the lookup string
